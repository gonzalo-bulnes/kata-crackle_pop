/* CracklePop
 *
 * Prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive).
 * If the number is divisible by 3, prints "Crackle" instead of the number.
 * If it's divisible by 5, prints "Pop".
 * If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, prints "CracklePop".
 *
 * This is a simple implementation to serve as a reference for benchmarks.
